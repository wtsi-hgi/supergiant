# Supergiant UI

This project was generated with [Angular CLI](https://github.com/angular/angular-cli).


## Quick Start for UI Development

Install system dependencies
  
* Node JS
* Yarn ([Instructions](https://yarnpkg.com/lang/en/docs/install/))
* Angular-cli `npm install -g @angular/cli`
* Node Packages `npm install`


## Development server

To run the development server, from the console:

```bash
ng serve -o
```

Angular will compile libraries and listen for changes. Use of the `-o` flag will open a new browser window to `http://localhost:4200/` when compiling is complete.

When changes are made to the library source files, the app will automatically reload for you.


## Creating new Features

Use Angular's scaffolding features to generate new components. [Consult the documentation](https://github.com/angular/angular-cli#generating-components-directives-pipes-and-services).


## Build

Run `ng build` to build the project. The build artifacts will be stored in the `dist/` directory. Use the `-prod` flag for a production build.


## Running unit tests

Run `ng test` to execute the unit tests via [Karma](https://karma-runner.github.io).


## Running end-to-end tests

Run `ng e2e` to execute the end-to-end tests via [Protractor](http://www.protractortest.org/).
Before running the tests make sure you are serving the app via `ng serve`.
